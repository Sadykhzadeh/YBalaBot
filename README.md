## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/sample.png)

This bot implements <a href="https://yandex.ru/lab/yalm">Yandex Balabola API</a> engine for easy-to-use Telegram inline mode.

Balaboba demonstrates how neural networks of the YaLM family can generate a coherent text on any topic, while maintaining a preset style. In Balaboba‚Äôs case, YaLM is used for entertainment, but the models were originally developed for serious tasks ‚Äì for example, to improve a search engine and develop a voice assistant.
